# Adventurously - Interactive Web Based Exploration of Climate Change

## Background

There has been increase in melting glaciers, rising sea levels, loss of forests, frequent forest fires, and scrambling wildlife. Experts say this is result of a phenomenon called *Global Warming*. 

Global Warming causes changes to long term weather patterns resulting in climate change, which leads to rising temperatures and extreme weather events.

This project is an attempt to create a web based interactive portal to enable exploration and analysis of empirical weather data and study of climate change.
